/// Central class for all backend execution state (example: the FragmentInstanceStates
/// of the individual fragment instances) created for a particular query.
/// This class contains or makes accessible state that is shared across fragment
/// instances; in contrast, fragment instance-specific state is collected in
/// FragmentInstanceState.
///
/// The lifetime of a QueryState is dictated by a reference count. Any thread that
/// executes on behalf of a query, and accesses any of its state, must obtain a
/// reference to the corresponding QueryState and hold it for at least the
/// duration of that access. The reference is obtained and released via
/// QueryExecMgr::Get-/ReleaseQueryState() or via QueryState::ScopedRef (the latter
/// for references limited to the scope of a single function or block).
/// As long as the reference count is greater than 0, all of a query's control
/// structures (contained either in this class or accessible through this class, such
/// as the FragmentInstanceStates) are guaranteed to be alive.
///
/// Query execution resources (non-control-structure memory, scratch files, threads, etc)
/// are also managed via a separate resource reference count, which should be released as
/// soon as the resources are not needed to free resources promptly.
///
/// When any fragment instance execution returns with an error status, all
/// fragment instances are automatically cancelled.
///
/// We maintain a state denoted by BackendExecState. We transition from one non-error
/// state to the next only if *all* underlying fragment instances have done so.
/// Eg: We transition from the PREPARING state to the EXECUTING state only if *all* the
/// underlying fragment instances have finished Prepare().
/// However, the behavior for transitioning from a non-error state to an error state is
/// different for different states. If any fragment instance hits an error or cancellation
/// during the EXECUTING state, then we immediately change the state of the query to the
/// ERROR or CANCELLED state accordingly.
/// However, if a fragment instance hits an error during Prepare(), we still wait for
/// *all* fragment instances to complete preparing before transitioning to the ERROR
/// state. This is to simplify the query lifecycle so that Prepare() is always completed
/// before it can handle either a Cancel() RPC or a PublishFilter() RPC.
///
/// Status reporting: all instances currently report their status independently.
/// Each instance sends at least one final status report with its overall execution
/// status, so if any of the instances encountered an error, that error will be reported.
///
/// Thread-safe, unless noted otherwise.
///
/// TODO:
/// - set up kudu clients in Init(), remove related locking
/// - when ReportExecStatus() encounters an error, query execution at this node
///   gets aborted, but it's possible for the coordinator not to find out about that;
///   fix the coordinator to periodically ping the backends (should the coordinator
///   simply poll for the status reports?)
